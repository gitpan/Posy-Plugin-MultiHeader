==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::MultiHeader - Posy plugin to enable multiple header templates.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.03'' of Posy::Plugin::MultiHeader.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin enables the user to create additional 'header' flavour templates
besides the normal 'header' one. These templates would be called, for
example, ``header1.html'', ``header2.html'' and so on.

This is particularly useful in conjunction with Posy::Plugin::Info, as one
can make multi-level headers which change depending on the sorted-by .info
fields.

This plugin replaces the 'header' action.


==   Cautions   ==

This does not play well with 'footer' templates.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``multi_header_max''
The maximum number of additional header levels to look for. (default: 0) Set
this to a number greater than zero to turn on this plugin.


==== INSTALLATION ====

Installation needs will vary depending on the particular setup a person has.


==   Administrator, Automatic   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, then the dead simple method of
installing the modules is to use the CPAN or CPANPLUS system.

    cpanp -i Posy::Plugin::MultiHeader

This will install this plugin in the usual places where modules get
installed when one is using CPAN(PLUS).


==   Administrator, By Hand   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, but don't wish to use the
CPAN(PLUS) method, then this is for you. Take the *.tar.gz file and untar it
in a suitable directory.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install


==   User With Shell Access   ==

If you are a user on a system, and don't have root/administrator access, you
need to install Posy somewhere other than the default place (since you don't
have access to it). However, if you have shell access to the system, then
you can install it in your home directory.

Say your home directory is "/home/fred", and you want to install the modules
into a subdirectory called "perl".

Download the *.tar.gz file and untar it in a suitable directory.

    perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules.

Therefore you will need to change the PERL5LIB variable to add
/home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
